function intersections = get_pseudo_intersections(cam1_loc,view1_dirs,cam2_loc,view2_dirs)
%Calculate 3D point that minimizes sum of squared distances to input
%viewing rays.
%inputs:
%    cam1_loc,cam2_loc: row vectors of camera location coordinates. These are the starting positions of viewing rays.
%    view_1_dirs,view2_dirs: 2D arrays of shape (3,num samples). The columns of these arrays are unit vectors specifying viewing ray
%                            directions. The columns in view1_dirs contain directions for rays starting from cam1_loc, and the 
%                            columns of view2_dirs contain directions for rays starting from cam2_loc. Additionally, The vector at
%                            column i of view1_dirs points to the same point as the vector in column i of view2_dirs.
%outputs:
%    intersections: 2D array of shape (3,num samples). Each column contains the identified 3D intersection point between a set of input viewing
%                   rays. Because viewing rays do not exactly intersect, the intersections are chosen as points that minimize the sum of squared 
%                   distances to both viewing rays.
